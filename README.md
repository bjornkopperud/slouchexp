# slouch
Slouch in development

## How to install this package
Careful, it is in development.

# Install & load devtools
```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

# Install and load this packaage
```
devtools::install_github("bjornkopperud/slouch")
library(slouch)
```

Since it is in development, I've changed the name of model.fit command, as to point out that it is in dev, to `model.fit.dev()`.

Rudimentary helpfiles exist, such as `?model.fit.dev`
